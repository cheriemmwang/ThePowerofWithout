# the-power-of-without

The Power of Without is a collaborative initiative among institutions and local communities for identifying cost-efficient, lightweight infrastructure systems for deployment in informal settlements, to foster sustainable, resilient, and autonomous communities. A taxonomy, and methodology based in a set of workshops and classes has been developed to learn from informality.
